Moreover most CSS3 new styles who would benefit this project (e.g. background-size), were not implemented yet. Therefore resizing the background image, keeping the full-screen resolution and respecting the aspect ratio whilst repositioning the icons to be on top of the appropriate elements of the image, required some tailored <strong>JavaScript</strong> to do all the math.</p><p><strong>Ajax</strong> was used to load pages built in PHP, calling a 3rd party <strong>web service</strong> to get all the data presented.<br />The <strong>PHP</strong> pages parsed all the returned <strong>XML</strong> from the chosen forecasting service and from the internal hotel bespoke system.<br />To achieve the final result, I had to work really close to the company that developed the aforementioned system.</p><p>The hard-work paid off by turning out to be one of the most enjoyable and beautifully designed projects I've ever worked on, even though the project could do some re-factoring and maintenance.</p><p><small>developed as a W20 employee.</small></p>",
